1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a test of the ASS format and some basic features in it.


2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
This and the previous line should both show at the bottom of the video in 20 pixel high white Arial with a 2 pixel black outline and 2 pixel offset shadow. This line is long so it should automatically be broken into several lines that are approximately even length, with upper lines being longer.


3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now going to test conflict resolution. 


4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
This line should be above the previous.


5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000 line:90% position:0% align:start
This line should be lower-left aligned using the \an1 override.


6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000 line:10% position:100% align:end
Upper right


7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
This one should be below the "Upper right" line and be centered on screen. It should also be in 40 pixel high Times New Roman.


8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
This should also be a toptitle in Times New Roman, but much smaller. Using an override tag to change size.


9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000 line:10% position:0% align:start
Top-left using the legacy \a5 tag


10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:50% position:50% align:center
This line is centered on screen.
At the bottom of the screen should be two lines in different layers, they are rendered on top of each other because conflict resolution only considers lines in the same layer.


11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is in layer 0


12
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this line is in layer 1


13
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another line in layer 0


14
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this line is in layer 1, but has changed its margins so it isn't exactly centered, and it's raised above the other line.


15
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Switching font inline, and resetting styles


16
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also switching to a different style inline


26
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some other basic font style tests:
Normal, <b>Boldface</b>, <i>Italics</i>, <u>Underline</u>, Strikethrough


27
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
There should be no linebreak here,\nbut there should be one here
so this is on a separate line.


28
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
This line is pushed left by adding some hard spaces to the right\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h


29
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regular spaces at line start/end are ignored, so this line is centered


30
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
This is a long line but it is not broken into several because it's using the \q override tag which changes the line-wrapping mode for a single line. The tag can take several values, 0 is the default which is "smart wrapping" with top lines longer, 1 is regular wrapping, 2 is no wrapping and 3 is smart-wrapping with bottom lines longer.


31
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:50% position:50% align:center
This is a long line using the \q1 override tag to get "dumb" wrapping, make as long lines as possible and first wrap when it'd go off screen. This is mostly visible when the last line generated is short.


32
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this line uses the \q3 wrapping style, which is similar to the \q0 default smart-wrap style, but has lower lines longer than the upper ones.


34
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000 line:50% position:50% align:center
All of this has no border or shadow...
This is bright red, green, blue
50% transparent


35
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Large inter-letter spacing


39
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now for karaoke!
